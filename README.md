## Problem 1: Trajectory-tracking
To run the code for problem 1 following packages are needed: 
>python3,  OpenCV,  numpy, matplotlib

### Steps to run the code: 

1. Place the files **vsingh03_code_problem1.py** and **ball.mov** in same folder
2. On the terminal change the directory where above two files are placed. 
3. Run the below command. This will run the code. The results will be displayed on terminal, graphs on separate window.

    python3 vsingh03_code_problem1.py

## Problem 2 : 3D-plane-fitting
To run the code for problem 2 following packages are needed:
